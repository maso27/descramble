A simple python script that prompts the user to enter a scrambled string of characters.
It then runs through all possible combinations and prints words.

Expects the "PyEnchant" library.
 <sudo apt install python3-enchant>

 <pip install PyEnchant>

If import fails, it just prints out ALL combinations of letters.
